### Inside of this repository

In this repository, the reader will encounter my solution to the homework assignment Python API. The repository is organized in folders and a README.md (The file you are currently reading). Here is the list of the folders and their contents so you can navigate through them.

1. **WeatherPy:** Inside this folder, you will have the chance to access my code for the assignment and all the output data. I encourage you to take a look inside as you will find the solution to the project and screenshots from it. Here are what's inside:


   * output_data: All images and csv files created for the project.
   * Heatmap.png: an image of the heatmap I created using Google API.
   * Heatmap_with_hotels: an image of the heatmap I created with reference points I created using Google API.
   * VacationPy-with-outputs: Here is my code for the vacation portion of the project.
   * WeatherPy-updated: Here is my code for the weather portion of the project.
2. README.MD: it's the current file you are reading. I strongly suggest navigating through it and look at the project's objective solution and analysis.

I hope you find my work not only to be complete but to display all the knowledge learned throughout this portion of the Data Science Bootcamp at Northwestern University.
